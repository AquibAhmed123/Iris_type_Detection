# Iris_type_Detection

This repository contains a project that focuses on predicting iris flower categories using classification. The project leverages a dataset with the following column names:

1)Id
2)SepalLengthCm
3)SepalWidthCm
4)PetalLengthCm
5)PetalWidthCm
6)Species

In this README file, we'll provide an overview of the project 

## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to predict the species of iris flowers based on various features. The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species of the iris flowers. Classification algorithms are used to categorize iris flowers into different species based on these measurements.

## Data
The dataset for this project is typically provided in CSV format. Ensure that the dataset contains the columns mentioned earlier for the project to work as expected. You may also need to preprocess the data if it's in a different format or if you have specific data cleaning and transformation requirements.
